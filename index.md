## Statement

Travelling in Mexico, learning Spanish and getting to know the culture. Arriving back in NZ late August.

## Experience

**Fisher & Paykel Healthcare** _Product Development Engineer_ **Feb-2016 to Mar-2018**

Highlights:

- **Product Owner - Initial Upgrade of Environmental Chamber:** Work was planned to increase the chamber's testing capacity. I was tasked with overseeing the upgrade, with minimal disruption to ongoing test requirements. I liaised with the relevant stakeholders to assess needs, expectations and required resources, using a visible GANTT chart to keep track of the estimated timeline. As unforeseen obstacles emerged, such as part supply delays, I made sure all stakeholders were informed and understood the current status of the project. _At the completion of the project, all parties were satisfied with both the outcome and having been well informed throughout._

* **Verification Testing:** The product must be thoroughly tested to prove it complies with international standards. I was tasked with carrying out a round of this testing. Each completed test was originally analysed using MS Excel, which was cumbersome and time consuming. I wrote a test script in MATLAB to automate this data analysis, reducing the total analysis time from more than a week to less than an hour. _As a result, not only was the testing completed successfully, but the process was streamlined and enabled us to be agile by identifying failed tests quickly and retesting them._

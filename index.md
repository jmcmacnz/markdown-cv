## Statement

After completing two years in product development at F&P Healthcare, I decided to leave my role on good terms to travel and pursue music and tech-related projects for the remainder of the year. Having worked as an engineer has helped me to develop a strong set of problem solving and analytical skills, while studying philosophy and French has strengthened my capacity to think critically and communicate effectively. This skillset enables me to adapt to a variety of working environments. I am seeking a role in a technological field that can provide me with challenging and engaging work and the opportunity to grow while applying myself in a professional environment.

## Experience

### **Fisher & Paykel Healthcare** _Product Development Engineer_ **Feb-2016 to Mar-2018**

#### Highlights:

- **Product Owner - Initial Upgrade of Environmental Chamber:** Work was planned to increase the chamber's testing capacity. I was tasked with overseeing the upgrade, ensuring minimal disruption to ongoing test requirements. I liaised with the relevant stakeholders to assess needs, expectations and required resources, using a visible GANTT chart to keep track of the estimated timeline. As unforeseen obstacles emerged, such as part supply delays, I made sure all stakeholders were kept informed and understood the current status of the project. _At the completion of the project, all parties were satisfied with both the outcome and having been involved in the process throughout._

* **Verification Testing:** Before the product can be sold, it must be thoroughly tested to prove it complies with international medical device standards. I was tasked with carrying out a round of this testing. Each completed test was previously analysed using MS Excel, which was cumbersome and time consuming. I wrote a test script in MATLAB to automate this data analysis, reducing the total analysis time from more than a week to less than an hour. _As a result, not only was the testing completed successfully, but the process was streamlined and enabled us to be agile by identifying failed tests quickly and retesting them._

* **Competitor Product Analysis:**

## Statement

Travelling in Mexico, learning Spanish and getting to know the culture. Arriving back in NZ late August.

## Experience

**Fisher & Paykel Healthcare** _Product Development Engineer_ **Feb-2016 to Mar-2018**

Highlights:

- **Product Owner - Initial Upgrade of Environmental Chamber:** Planned work to increase the chamber's testing capacity. I was tasked with overseeing the upgrade, with minimal disruption to ongoing test requirements. I liaised with the relevant stakeholders to assess needs, expectations and required resources, using a visible GANTT chart to keep track of the estimated timeline. As unforeseen obstacles emerged, such as part supply delays, I made sure all stakeholders were informed and understood the current status of the project. At the completion of the project, all parties were satisfied with both the outcome and having been well informed throughout.

* **Verification Testing:** Product must be thoroughly tested to prove it complies with international standards. Tasked with carrying out a round of this testing. Each completed test was originally analysed with MS Excel, which was cumbersome and time consuming, so I wrote a test script in MATLAB to automate this data analysis. As a result, the testing process was greatly sped up and enabled us to be more agile by identifying failed tests quickly and retesting them. This also laid the foundation for future increases in testing efficiency.
